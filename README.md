# sql-challenge

The project was done for the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp using PostgeSQL and includes both data modeling / data engineering and data analysis. 

First, an ERD of the data was created using QuickDBD. The data, provided in CSV format, was inspected and the relationships between tables visualized in the ERD.

The next step was creating tables in SQL and importing the data. Tables had to be created and data imported to them in a specific order, as reflected in the text file showing code and the schemata.sql file, due to some tables containing foreign keys dependent on other tables.
